Hi, I'm Ben! I'm a software developer at AWS, living in Vancouver and
originally from the UK. I started this blog to track my progress and work in
the open while I was doing my MSc in Computer Science in 2020/21. I haven't
updated it much since then.

Right now I'm working on the Distributed SQL team at AWS, building a new 
database. In general I'm working on/interested in:
- Learning how to be a better and faster engineer in my day job
- Getting better at writing Rust
- Learning and reading about distributed systems
- Learning more about parsing, ASTs, compilers, and programming language
    theory.

If you'd like to chat to me about anything you can reach me at blog (at)
benjscho.dev

Thanks for visiting, and drop me a message if you want to talk about anything you've read.
