Hi, I'm Ben! I'm a software developer at AWS, living in Seattle.

Right now I'm working on the Distributed SQL team at AWS, building a new 
database ([Aurora DSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/dsql/)). In general 
I'm working on/interested in:
- Learning and reading about distributed systems (I post some summaries of papers I've read here)
- Learning how to be a better and faster engineer in my day job
- Getting better at writing code, recently Rust in particular

If you'd like to chat to me about anything you can reach me at blog (at)
benjscho.dev

Thanks for visiting, and drop me a message or an email if you want to talk about 
anything you've read.
