This is just a platform for me to get the feel of writing in an open forum, and to also keep myself on track for what will hopefully be a busy year. I should be posting a range of stuff on here, mainly keeping regular weeknotes, but with occasional technical or personal bits.

Thanks for visiting, and drop me a message if you want to talk about anything you've read.
