This is my rough sketch of advice for people trying to get their first role. A lot of this is synthesized and regurgitated from what others have told me, so might be pretty recognizable! [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.ca/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) is a really excellent resource for all of this too.

## Getting an interview

Tech companies look for engineers that know data, know how it can tell a story, how to get it, what's important, and how you can use it to support your arguments. Your CV should reflect this. Try to identify and include nuggets of data about your previous experiences. Say you were part of a student society that held events, did you grow their attendance by some %age year on year? Companies want to see that you can set goals for improvement and hit them, or at least have awareness of it. Include this in both your CV bullet points and in your interview prep. 

When it comes to applications, a referral is at least 10X more effective than applying to a portal when it comes to getting you through the first screening. After that it's up to you, but it's a great way to get the first intro to a company. There's so many low quality submissions that come in through online application portals that it's very hard for recruiters to screen. 

If you have a target company you want to work at, try and get a referral instead of applying for a job just through a portal. Look up people that work there on linkedin, and filter by some criteria that's connected to you. Look for mutual connections, that you went to the same school, etc. that's not the key part but it helps people have familiartiy. Reach out to them with a short message about yourself, what you're aiming for, and ask if they can refer you. If there's a position advertised you're looking at, reach out to the hiring manager and ask for more information

## Interview prep

Have a 50/50 emphasis split on leadership principles (stories about what work you've done in the past and how they show certain characteristics the company is looking for) vs DSA coding skills (leetcode or whatever other platform). You should prepare the stories for interviews in much the same way you prepare your coding skills. 

Write out a grid of all of the various experiences you had against all of the public values that your target company displays (e.g., Amazon LPs, other companies have different principles). For each box write a few bulletpoints in the STAR format (situation, task, action, result) about the story, talking about how you demonstrated that principle. People care most about the action and the result, while the situation and the task are the context so they can understand. You should be able to relay these stories in around 5 minutes.

When it comes to the interview process, _performing_ that you understand and can demonstrate what they want to see is as good as actually doing it. Interviewers want to know that you can play the game of internal values, because that's how companies organise ourselves without pulling in many different directions. They're used and prioritised in all company decisions, hiring, project prioritisation. Playing a role in a company is as good as _being_ the role. 

When it comes to interviewing, come with a few questions. It's your chance to learn about the place too, what the day to day is like. Be curious about the team and the work.
