I haven't written anything in a good long while as I've been focusing on the
various coursework and exams that came along. It's good to be
coming out of the other side.

Essentially it's just been a bit of a grindy month, and nothing interesting
has happened, not that any of my COVID lockdown life has been particularly
interesting. The last few weeks of the taught portion of my course have passed,
thankfully uneventfully. I completed all of my work on time, slowly and
steadily, now there's just one exam next week before I'm on to the summer
dissertation grind. It's smooth sailing from May 24th to the 3rd of September
due date.

While getting this coursework done I definitely learnt a lot about how
I like to work too. Having a steady daily word count helped me get what I
needed to done without any real stress. It's the extra planning that makes a
difference, knowing when you need to push and when you can say that's good
enough for today really helps reduce any stress around being examined. It's
a good lesson I'll be taking forward with my dissertation work over the next
few months, small incremental goals.

It's all passed surprisingly quickly, the two thirds of a year I've spent
studying so far. Things are beginning to reopen in the UK as the vaccine
roll out (our one COVID success) carries on. Most have my family have been
vaccinated, I'm just waiting to see when the shots drop through the ages and
I can finally get mine.

The week after my final exam I have my rescheduled driving test, originally
meant to happen in November. With the lockdown exit ongoing, and a bit more
mobility I'll hopefully be seeing more friends over the summer. I can recommend
a monastic year to do an MSc to anyone though, it's nice to get through
without any distractions. In the summer I'll be applying for jobs too, and
potentially looking to pick up a little part time IT/coding work if I can
find any near Bath!

Bit of a backlog on the reading list, hoping to take a break next week once
the final exam is done and get away from screens a bit more.

    - I'm appreciating the importance of types a hell of a lot more after a semester both working with Haskell, and trying to read machine learning code in Python. Anything to do with having to work through type strict languages makes me think about the truism that weeks of programming can save you hours of planning.
