Just got back from the first weekend spent with a big group of friends in a
long while. It was so good to spend time wandering about, eating and drinking
together. Highly recommended.

It's been a few weeks since I've written up my weeknotes (becoming more
fortnightly, and now a week further than that). The dissertation is a bit of a
grind for the moment. My experiments have been going well, and I seem on track
as I get into the final stretch. Just 25 working days until it's due, 33
including weekends.  Nothing has changed drastically, there's just a lot of
incremental progress and I haven't had much bandwidth on anything else. I still
need to figure out my next stages after the dissertation, but my loose plan is
to get out to Vancouver and work it out from there.

Because it's been so long since the last post I've got a lot of reading links.

# Reading List
- [Gabriella Hirst: An English Garden](http://gabriellahirst.com/An-English-Garden)
    - This work was censored recently by a group of Conservative councillors in
      the area it was located. It was an artwork that launched a discussion
      about Britain's history of creating nuclear weapons, and testing them on
      unceded indigenous Australian land. This is an example of the worst
      ahistorical nimby English instinct.

      engagement.

    - The pure, deadly statistics of climate change terrify me: "Britain’s
      Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office estimated that the
      likelihood of an extreme heatwave capable of wiping out the southern
      Chinese rice crop in a given year was 1 in 100 under 1°C of warming, but
      one in ten under 2-3°C of warming". We're expected to see between 2-3
      degrees of warming, these weather events are already happening with
      increasing and alarming regularity.
