I truly hate dealing with dependencies. Trying to get to grips with some
neural net techniques for machine learning this week. <!--more-->
The most frustrating part has just been checking you have the right library
installed, or then you think you do, the code seems to run but hangs endlessly,
so you do some googling and find out you have the wrong version installed.
Then I threw in trying to do this on the university's GPU compute cloud with
Docker images in the mix, and I can't keep track of the images. It's a mess,
I think I'm mostly there now.

For our group reinforcement learning project we're aiming to apply
[PPO](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/) to Super Mario Bros for
the old NES. This is a pretty feasible problem with plenty of demonstrations
around, just steadily working through it at the moment! The PPO paper is one
of the most confusing pieces I've read. It makes it so hard to understand
how the algorithm actually functions, while somehow giving enough info to
recreate it. I'm very grateful to [Phil Tabor](https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/PPO/torch)
for giving an implemented demonstration. There is also the [Stable-baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines/blob/master/stable_baselines/ppo2/ppo2.py)
version, but that's significantly harder to read.

Alongside working on that I've been steadily progressing with my lit review,
mostly making my daily word count. The Easter break comes to an end tomorrow,
so it's a 3 week slog to the end now. I have 4 pieces of coursework due between
26th April and 5th May, and I'm currently 0/4. Maybe 0.5/4. Everything is in
motion, I just need to pick the speed up a little. It feels like my skills
are really improving at the moment, which is the benefit of the work.

My life is still pretty much just the MSc for the moment. Lockdown's easing
another stage tomorrow, so I might be able to be a little less hermetic
following that. I'm finally getting insured on my Dad's car so I can get some
practice in prior to my test at the end of May. Getting through the days.
