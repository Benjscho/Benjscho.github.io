Halfway through my dissertation now! I'm at the point of getting results and
starting to draw some graphs on my first experiments.
<!--more-->
Still feeling pretty good about my progress, but I'm definitely anxious to get
all of the experimental runs going in the next week so I can iron out issues
in plenty of time, and really get going with the analysis.

I've been running more, did my first Sunday long run today. I'm going to try
and get into the habit of 2-3 short runs and one long a week. Would be nice
to build up to a half marathon, or just longer runs in general. Always feel
good after getting back, so it's definitely something to keep up with. I've
never really been a runner, or in the habit of any regular exercise previously
so this is a good development for me.
