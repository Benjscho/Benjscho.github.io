It's one of those days where I've had too much coffee and my heart feels like
it's resting rate is 10bpm faster than it should be. It has been a productive
morning.  <!--more--> I handed in my first large coursework of the semester,
30% of a course that is itself 40% of the semester, and so a hand in that's
worth 4% of my overall degree. Either way it went smoothly despite the absence
of my partner this morning. I'm ahead in most of the coursework for the
semester, with half either handed in or 95% of the way there. It feels like a
comfortable space to be in.

In other very exciting news I've agreed to buy a motorbike from a local seller.
It's an old Kawasaki ER-5, initially built in 1997 and registered in 1999.
Despite being only a year younger than me, it's in pretty good shape. The guy
I'm buying it from put a lot of money into the bike, new exhaust, new rear
shocks, new fork seals, new sprocket and chain. Overall it's a very fair deal
and a good runner. My Mod 2 isn't for a little while yet but it's very exciting
to have this ready for when I am road legal.

I had my dad with me when I went to look at the bike, he used to ride himself,
and as an electrical engineer/kit car builder in the past it was extremely
handy having his opinion. I'm just as grateful for the conversations something
like a bike can set off. We get to talk about the purpose of mechanical
objects, how he'd rather I didn't ride one, but can't hold it against me since
he has in the past. We talked about how you obviously don't want your loved
ones to take on unnecessary risk, but you do want them to live and enjoy their
lives.

My sister's very adventurous, far more so than I am. A great pursuer of [Type
II Fun](https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale). One of my favourite stories
of hers is from Alpine crevasse training. With three of them roped up together
on the glacier (one instructor, two learners), they found a good looking
crevasse, and took turns walking off the edge into thin air. It would be the
responsibility of the two at the top to arrest the fall, set up an effective
ice axe pulley system, and pull the third from the crevasse. Of course
practicing this with an instructor around, when you're expecting it to happen,
all of that is to set you up for the situations when you don't know it's
coming, when one of you suddenly steps off the edge.

There's not much more point to that story but I love the images in it. Maybe the
point is that nobody in my family can blame me for doing something
statistically risky in the pursuit of a little fun and freedom. I've been
reading Matthew Crawford's *Why We Drive* recently, still very early on, but
I'm very much enjoying it so far. It's in the same vein as his book *The Case
for Working with Your Hands*, partly a cry against a purposeless modernism that
seems to crush meaning for the individual, and partly a worship of how clever
the things we've made are, how they can help us engage with the world. Please
take that with a pinch of salt, it's a crude summary. I like his writing and
his thinking, only getting to engage with this side of it now I am becoming a
driver, what he calls *homo moto*. For a while too I've tried to get on my way
to Hannah Arendt's *homo faber*, the fundamental part of us that just wants to
make things. With an old bike I'll have plenty to practice on.

	> Another objection that I’ve heard is that I should not say free will does not exist because that would erode people’s moral behavior. The concern is, you see, that if people knew free will does not exist, then they would think it doesn’t matter what they do. This is of course nonsense. If you act in ways that harm other people, then these other people will take steps to prevent that from happening again. This has nothing to do with free will. We are all just running software that is trying to optimize our well-being. If you caused harm, you are responsible, not because you had “free will” but because you embody the problem and locking you up will solve it.
