It's been a pretty calm week this end. Things are picking up on the course, the
first few courseworks are popping up so I'm trying to get into a habit of
batting those down and getting a submission in. <!--more--> Larger work is looming on the
horizon. Autumn is settling in down in Bromham. I can just about see the church
spire over the trees from my study window. The colours are split between the
evergreens and yellow dashed trees on their way to losing their leaves. By the
time I'm at my desk the light is still streaking in low. It's very nice just to
be around, which makes it easier to get things done and keep feeling good.

Something one of my tutors said this week stuck with me, it was while he was
teaching us how to construct
[DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) diagrams
from their formal definitions. He made it clear that this was a creative
practice, that there was no way to brute force this kind of thing, and that the
only way to become good at it was through studying examples and attempting
exercises. I think that essentially holds true across a lot of the aspects of
programming and CS that are incredibly creative processes. You've just got to
put in the work, and look at the examples, and take it from there.

I'm very much getting into the note taking and prep work from all of the
lectures and online materials. I think the shift to online materials is
absolutely fantastic. Compared to lectures only held at a certain time, it's so
much more freeing as a student to be able to manage your time, batch together
topics, and move through them at your own pace. There's so much less time lost
with all of the interstitial bits of moving about a campus, or commuting.
Although, the one in person session a week is still a highlight purely for the
chance to get a few beers at the SU afterwards. Meeting people in your
discipline or adjacent areas is one of the best things that being at a
University affords. It's obviously a weird time with the many safeguarding
measures but it's amazing how normal it can feel. I'm still very envious of my
partner who spent every Thursday afternoon for the second year of her masters
boozing in the grad bar with the professors of courses she was a TA on.
Hopefully we'll get there soon.

Starting to get güd at [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) has been a saviour
for my notes. I've got a reasonable amount of Algebraic topics, each using
their own subset of notation. I'm using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for
this which just makes taking notes really pleasurable. It's objectively quite
Nerdy Shit ✅ but it also feels very freeing. Slightly hackerman-esque, like the
guilty rush of using Vim that makes you want to brag to everyone that you've
figured it out and you're a productivity machine.

Look at that sweet subscript.

The most exciting news of the week was that Canada is now making travel
exemptions for people in unmarried committed relationships! My partner is
Canadian, and we haven't seen each other since February so I'm hopefully going
to get out there for Christmas. There are a few bureaucratic hoops to jump
through (she has to swear a very formal oath in front of a notary) but it's
really not too bad. This is thanks to the activism of people who have it a lot
worse than us, families who've been separated while relatives are dying. It
still feels like we're just beginning but that's a very exciting thing to look
forward to, government willing.

  This isn't that new but it's incredibly cool technology as the [Thought
  Emporium](https://youtu.be/YlQT4ptwLKs) on YouTube runs through here. It
  sounds like this company is aiming to take advantage of the same process
  which is already in industrial use by wine makers. The process of making
  great tasting spirits has come on a lot, and I personally think purism in
  this space is bullshit. The issue is the spirits market sells the experience
  and feeling of luxury, most of it is marketing and huge markups.

Particularly Annex 2 which describes as an overview the data processing practices of SCL/CA. Find this super interesting, how much is actually marketing fluff, and how much was actually damaging or illegal practice. The truth is always more mundane than the exaggerated stories being told, but just still incredibly interesting.
