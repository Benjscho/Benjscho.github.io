The Army has been conducting firing exercises on Salisbury Plain, about 20
miles from where I live, so I've had a distant booming as background noise
for the last week.
<!--more-->
It kind of sounds like a truck hitting a dip in the road, but every 30 seconds.
Focusing on getting things done around that has been fun.

A few good developments this week, I got my final grades back from last
semester so I'm now conclusively sitting on a decent first for the moment. In
addition I now have the supervisor and the topic for my dissertation, I'll be
working on learning to play Tetris using AI over the summer. This is a good
intersection of interesting vs. tractable in a problem. Tetris is NP-complete
with perfect information, so it's a perfect candidate for AI solutions. I need
to think about my approach for the next few weeks and catch up on the relevant
literature, but that should definitely keep me occupied over the summer, and
hopefully lead to a decent submission for my dissertation.

This weekend I'll be taking part in [Hack the Burgh](https://2021.hacktheburgh.com/).
It's my first hackathon, and I'm tackling it with a team of other Bath MSc
students, so hopefully we'll have a good time and create something worth
sharing. Aside from coursework deadlines, I haven't had much practice working
on delivering software, so this should be a really good time constrained
exercise for me.

I'm just about reaching the midway of my master's now. It's been a brilliant
course, very grateful to Bath for the level of teaching at an incredibly
strenuous time. Hopefully the rest of it unfolds as smoothly as the first half.

    > "The term ‚Äúalgorithm,‚Äù however defined, shouldn‚Äôt be a shield to absolve the humans who designed and deployed any system of responsibility for the consequences of its use. This is why the public is increasingly demanding algorithmic accountability‚Äîand the concept of impact offers a useful common ground for different groups working to meet that demand."

    - This has to be seen purely for the typographic attacks (writing 'iPod' on a piece of paper convincing the neural net that it's an iPod), but very interesting that we're seeing concepts responded to when presented in different modal ways! Absent concept research is another really interesting future research direction highlighted.
- [It Can Happen to You](https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/)
    - Interesting point about documentation for functions potentially listing time complexity to prevent pitfalls like this happening in future.
