I'm back in the UK, just before the stricter requirements for return came in,
although I still had the pleasure of a nasal COVID test before flying (not the
most fun).
<!--more-->
Now I'm quarantining for the return period, so I'm locked up in the house,
which isn't particularly a bad thing. My only other option for activity is
running.

I finished the last of my Semester 1 exams today. They were all formatted as
open book, 24 hr take homes designed to take 2 hrs each, which is now
absolutely my favourite way to be examined. If you have the patience and the
ability it's not just a test of recall, but instead how well you can do without
the pressure of an exam hall and a tight time scale to get it done in. Hopefully
the results I get back prove it helped, but I was a big fan of the process
itself.

I'm gradually getting over the jet lag after returning. Canada was fantastic,
and I can't wait to get out there permanently when I can get a visa sorted.
For the moment I have a blank few weeks, waiting for the next term to start,
waiting for my quarantine to finish. I finally have my motorbike insured so I'm
excited to give that a bit of a run once I'm allowed on the streets again. I
need to put some feelers out about part time work, hopefully to build up my
experience and boost my funds a little. Otherwise it's a nice relaxed time for
now.
