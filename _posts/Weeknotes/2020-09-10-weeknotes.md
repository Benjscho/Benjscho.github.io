So far this week has been fantastic. It's been my first time off working in about 6 months (I handily squeezed all of my holiday in before travel shut down and we made the big switch to remote working). I've mostly spent it on a project to sort out a new massive desk for myself as I'm going to be studying mostly from home for the next year.

I can always recommend having more desk space to work with. It's like monitors, everything fills up somehow but the extra room feels so much more productive. It's like the idea of mapping your mental reality to the external world, as we do with maps, contact books, etc. More room = more stuff. A lot of it is probably a placebo, but it still feels good.

I am undoubtedly incredibly lucky to have this much space to play with. I moved out of London in June, so I'm back in Wiltshire at the moment. The countryside has its perks but poor public transport is not one of them, so I've been slowly learning to drive, and taking some motorbiking lessons for good measure. I had another of these today, the first on the bigger 650cc bikes. Pretty glorious weather but I'm aching from it now.

I've lined up both of my theory tests for Monday so I'll be studying more over the weekend. I'm in the final few weeks of my job now, we're just finalising my replacement. In the meantime my focus is shifting slightly to the prep for my course, mainly revising some maths that I've all but forgotten since my A-Level in
the distant year of 2014.
