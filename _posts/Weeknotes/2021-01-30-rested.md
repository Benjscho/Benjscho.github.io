Last week before my courses kick off again, and my first week out of quarantine.
I've been enjoying getting back outside, getting on some walks and runs.

I also took my motorbike out for the first proper spin and shake down,
everything seems good with it. I managed to crack the instrument panel so I
swapped that out for a replacement.

Apart from that I've been cracking on with Leetcode problems, keeping the
streak going. I've now solved 5% of the available problems, so if I keep going
at that rate I should be able to manage 30% over the next six months, which
would put me in a good place for coming out the other end of my degree.

I'm a little nervous/excited about the new term, I'm expecting it to be a lot
tougher and less introductory, but that's what I'm on the course for. The
grades so far have been positive.

Getting through the isolation of the latest lockdown, very lucky to be with
family at the moment. It's a lot easier and healthier than the first two months
back in March 2020 when I was alone in a flat in London. Day by day anyway.
