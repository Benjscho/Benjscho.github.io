On the first day after saying goodbye to the second lockdown I passed my
motorbike test on direct access. It was an absurdly miserable day,
<!--more-->
I woke up at 6:30am to make it down to my instructor at 8:00. We rode over to
Swindon and spent the four hours we had left before my test sharpening up my
riding to the point I wasn't getting any better. Despite the rain, and the cold
I managed to pass with only a few minors. It was incredibly satisfying. Probably
the most strenuous thing that I've done for a little while. The test passed so
quickly I thought I'd failed and my examiner was bringing me back in early.
On the ride back home my instructor let me enjoy the new found freedom by
leaving me in the dust when we hit the main road heading back to Devizes. He
gave me a wave and sped away. The road back through Wiltshire is particularly
stunning. I know exactly what other motorcyclists mean when they talk about it
being close to flying. Hurtling along at 60-70mph feels like flying not because
it's effortless like a Peter Pan daydream, but exactly because you're out in
the open. You can feel the pressure on your body as you shunt the air out of
your way. Going fast it's a hard tug on the chest.

On the other side of very exciting news, I'm getting ready to fly to Canada
this Thursday coming to see my partner for Christmas! All the presents are
sorted, almost everything is ready, all the tickets booked, the permissions to
travel, just a few bits of coursework to clear before I'm on the way. It's
been a fantastic term of learning, and I'm really looking forward to having a
good long break, and seeing Dani again after so long, particularly with all of
the misery that's gone on this year. I'm feeling very lucky.
