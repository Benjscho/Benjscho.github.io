So what's going on? I had four pieces of coursework to hand in on Monday of
this week, but being the highly organised, enlightened, best grad-student
version of myself that I am, I had them all done by last Friday.  <!--more-->
Extremely irritating right? I'm trying to be a lot better than I was during my
undergrad, which means no all nighters, proper planning and always
overestimating how long things will take. It's going pretty well so far.

It's now under a month until I'm off to Canada for Christmas, which means I
need to be on top of getting all of my remaining pieces of coursework out the
way. Seems to be going well so far. The only struggle at the moment is getting
momentum going for a large group coursework. My control freak tendencies
keep showing up, but I'm managing to keep a lid on them. I think it's helpful
to have that in part, good to put some fire into the engine, but you want to
get the best out of everyone, so that means letting things go and figuring
out how the work will emerge from the group as a team. It's a really great
exercise, practicing Agile dev techniques for the first time, in a pretty
(grand scheme of things) low risk environment.

# Doing things, calling it a life

Spending a lot of time also working on computational languages. The Foundations
of Computation has unexpectedly turned out to be my favourite course this
semester. The next challenge there is to write a parser that will take a
context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, a word $w$, and return a parse
tree for the word if it is in the grammar. All of the problems in computation
are really fascinatingly low level, and have a nice mix of the creative and the
technical. It's an excuse to mess around with MathJax to represent all of my
notes, compiled languages are great.

I've been working on my bike a little this week. Some parts came so I got the
tachometer working again. My dad was on hand for the soldering, when you have
an electrical engineer at hand you'd be foolish not to take advantage of it.
It has honestly been very nice working on the bike with my dad, a nice way to
spend time mulling over mechanical things and learning from him. Another thing
I'm learning about mechanical projects is the to-do list never seems to get
shorter when you're working on a bike or a car. You find new things to do
just as you scratch old ones off. I still need to adjust the tick over speed,
replace the backlight bulbs in the instrument panel, fit the heated grips I got,
and then potentially strip off the tank and most of the cylinder head cover
to check the valve clearances as "they don't sound quite right" (again
according to my dad, but I do trust his judgement more than mine). It's
definitely rideable but got to love a project.

Something I've found myself missing the most recently is dinner parties. I miss
eating with my friends, breaking bread. I miss yelling about stupid things, and
drinking a lot of wine. The closest I've had to this recently has been a few
rounds of Among Us with folk from my course. Incredibly silly fun game to play
with people.  I have been pinging back and forth with various people recently,
which has been very nice. It feels good to find ways to be in conversation
with each other, sharing and learning things. That's part of what I'm enjoying
about writing this blog recently, just the act of writing helps focus what I've
been thinking about, and what I feel's worth sharing.
