Last week was the New Year so I took a week off (even though these are hardly
long blogs).
<!--more-->
I'm still in Vancouver, although I'm flying back to the U.K. -- plague island
as it otherwise seems to be known-- on Thursday 14th, providing everything
goes okay. The time here with Dani has been amazing, I feel so lucky to
have been able to spend this time together, and hopefully the next time I'm
here it will be to stay.

We rang in the new year with some cocktails, homemade blinis and caviar, and
a lot of food. Since then I've been getting some runs in, bouncing around
the city, eating donuts. Dani's back at work, I'm spending the day revising
for my exams and doing [DSA](https://leetcode.com/) problems. I need to slowly
ramp up the programming problem practice over the next 8 months in prep for
job applications at the end of the degree.
