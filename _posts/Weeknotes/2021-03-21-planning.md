Currently trying to pull together a first draft of my dissertation project
proposal, and it's going slowly.
<!--more-->
I've just spent three hours fixing a $\LaTeX$ export error instead of writing,
how's everyone else's Sunday going? Just a formative piece at this stage,
but I'm still feeling very sluggish.

With that I've been slowly getting back into the swing of things this week.
There's a fair few pieces of coursework which I haven't started yet, so I
definitely need to turn towards those once the proposal is out of the way.
I've spoken to a few others on the course and luckily it's not just me that's
been feeling in the doldrums at the moment. I think it's got to be a little
combination of everything, the materials this semester are more difficult
but we have more time to take it in. There's been even less human contact
this semester since we've been in lockdown for the duration of it. Now we're
at the midway point of the course and things are getting tricky. We have
an Easter break coming up so hopefully I'll be able to break the back of the
remaining work then.

In a more exciting vein, I rode over to Bristol yesterday to catch up with a
friend now we're allowed to meet outside for walks. It was a very much needed
boost to my sanity, and my first time riding the motorbike on the motorway.
I can see why bikers tend to avoid it, the wind speed makes the riding pretty
miserable on a naked bike, even with the small fairing I put on mine. I'm
planning on doing some longer rides when things are open again, so it was
a good test run for my kit.
