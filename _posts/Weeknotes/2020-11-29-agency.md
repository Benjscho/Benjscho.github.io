Making more progress towards the end of term, doing a little reading regarding
the agency of AI, and generally ticking over.
<!--more-->
It's been a good week. I've ticked off another major coursework that had to be
done before I finish for the semester. Aside from that everything else is
making nice progress.

I haven't really left the house since the beginning of this second lockdown.
I've been out for walks and exercise, and once or twice to the shops, but apart
from that I've just been sticking it out with work and my view of the pigeons.
This is probably the number one reason everything is going so well for me as a
graduate student. A friend pointed this out to me on a call today, I've always
been a bit of a nerd, but I also love life. Unlike during my undergrad, there's
not an awful lot of life to go around loving at the moment, so I'm just nerding
out every day.

# Parsing

This week part of the play has been with parsing. We've been asked to implement
a brute force parser that takes a context-free grammar, and a word, and returns
the parse tree of that word if it is in the grammar. I initially completed this
with the [CYK algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm) before I
found out the choice was a little more strict. The CYK algorithm has the benefit
of $O(n^3 \times |G|)$ complexity, which seems high but is still a lot better
than brute force, where you generate all possible derivations for step length
of $2n - 1$, where n is the length of the word in question. I'm not sure what
the learning goal is in having us use the brute force algorithm, but I have
learned how quickly that complexity balloons. I haven't yet played around with
probabilistic parsing which seeks to reduce the best case complexity, but that
sounds interesting.

# Robot agency

On another side I've been introduced to the writing of [Joanna
Bryson](https://www.joannajbryson.org/), who was at Bath until very recently.
Ethical AI, and the ethics of robotics/technology seem like absolutely
fascinating areas, so I'm finding opportunities to bend my work towards that.
At the moment I'm just wriggling my way through some of the most central
papers in the area, and hopefully I'll be able to develop a better sense of
what's going on. This is something I need to read more on, but questions of
whether we would ever want to grant robots or AI agency, and who would that
serve are really engaging. Picking up [Patiency is not a
virtue](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10676-018-9448-6) and
[Can a Robot Be a Good Colleague?](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-019-00172-6)
to get started.

I feel that early struggle of trying to get the lay of the land in a discipline
at the moment. It's still a struggle since I'm still discovering what I don't
know enough about, the unknown unknowns for me. I'm only just going through
the foundations with Turing Machines so getting to a place where I feel I can
grok the conversations happening feels a bit overwhelming, more so than it
did when I was tackling an English degree (somehow the stakes for originality
felt lower there, not to insult it at all). Anyway, it's all forward progress.

# Brief rant

I'm frustrated again by the false dichotomy presented repeatedly in the UK of
trading lessened economic impact for lost lives during the COVID-19 response
and with lockdowns. Good public health has massive economic benefits. Upstream
interventions save lives and protect economic upsides. Similarly lack of
upstream public health interventions negatively impacts the economy.

Following on from [this article in the FT today](https://www.ft.com/content/1f52fd2b-7daf-418e-be8b-acc38f819b8d)
the UK has now spent more as a proportion of GDP than any other G7 country to
mitigate the pandemic, and it has had the worst outcome **both in health and
economic terms**. The research points to our late lockdowns, and dithering
decisions. Delaying the lockdowns (both the first and the second time) beyond
the point at which it was clear they were needed means they have to go on for
much longer, and have lesser impact. The leadership of the country has failed
in so many ways, but there seems to be no ongoing acknowledgement or response
for the failures. It feels like criticism of this government, which has now
been in power since 2010 in some form and iteration of leadership, hasn't
been punching through. It's an extremely depressing way to see your country go
as public trust is hammered through inept and corrupt governance. The only
thing that seems to be discouraging young mobile adults from emigrating is
the fact that from the 1st of January we can no longer move and work freely
in the Schengen Area.
There's light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccines coming at least.
