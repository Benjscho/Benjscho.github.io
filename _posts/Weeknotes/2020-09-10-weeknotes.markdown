So far this week has been fantastic. It's been my first time off working in about 6 months (I handily squeezed all of my holiday in before travel shut down and we made the big switch to remote working). I've mostly spent it on a project to sort out a new massive desk for myself as I'm going to be studying mostly from home.

I moved out of London in June, so I'm back in Wiltshire at the moment. The countryside has its perks but poor public transport is not one of them, so I've been slowly learning to drive, and taking some motorbiking lessons for good measure. I had another of these today, the first on the bigger 650cc bikes. Pretty glorious weather but I'm aching from it now.
