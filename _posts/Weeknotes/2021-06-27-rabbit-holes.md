It was really hot, now it's back to relatively normal temperatures. The
pendulum of British summer is swinging around.

For the past two weeks I've been steadily making more progress on my
dissertation. I started going down the rabbit hole of Cython, which really
enjoyed. The performance improvements in comparison to plain Python are very
impressive, particularly when you move full loops into the Cython files. It's
incredibly easy to get a project up and running with a boilerplate `setup.py`
file. I don't come from a C/C++ background but my few experiences with those
have been a lot more awkward in keeping track of make files and libraries,
particularly when implementing nested data structures. I'd like to be more
skilled at that, but I don't have enough time to get deep into the C basis
while meeting the targets I need to for my dissertation as well.

Alongside my dissertation I've been auditing one of the undergraduate modules
that runs through topics like multiprocessing, GUI development, and design
patterns. It's been very interesting to go through so far, and a real reminder
that the MSc only has enough time to really pack in the fundamentals and
provide a challenge to learn further. I'm spending today working on
reimplementing a Sudoku solver I wrote in Python this past term in Java with
a GUI interface. Always interesting to learn different quirks of a platform
through a quick project while trying to get up to speed on different tech.

Starting to shoot out some job applications as and when I see approachable
positions come up. Fingers crossed as those go out.
