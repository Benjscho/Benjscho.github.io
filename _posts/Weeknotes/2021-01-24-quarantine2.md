This week has been a real in-between week, all of my Semester 1 exams are done,
I haven't been able to leave the house due to my returning quarantine, and I
don't have any new work to do.
<!--more-->
I'm still trying to fill it as best I can. Mostly I've been doing a lot of
data structures and algorithms practice, and then also trying to get better
at chess. You can see my [profile on Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/steepben)
if you want to see how that's going.

A lot of my friends are posting about the boredom of the latest lockdown.
Sarah Manavis wrote a [great article](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2021/01/it-s-not-just-you-why-current-lockdown-having-extreme-effect-mental-health)
about why this latest lockdown feels different. For those of us that are lucky
the boredom is the worst part, for a lot of other people in the country it's
much harder. The mismanagement of this crisis by my government has caused the
deaths of countless people and hasn't held onto any economic standing. The
choices between hard lockdowns and keeping the economy going have been shown
to be false equivalences as countries that treated coronavirus like SARS,
pursuing aggressive elimination policies, have been able to emerge and live
normally. It's so much harder to stay positive in this lockdown since we've
already seen the effects of 10 months of failing government policy. At best
the Conservatives have been inept, and at the worst corrupt in their handling
of contracts.

Trying not to be too negative about it all. Just another armchair critic but
it doesn't exactly fill me with confidence in the UK, particularly with
[Brexit slowly tanking things](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/23/brexit-hit-firms-advised-government-officials-set-up-shop-in-eu).

I'm looking for some part-time work too, would be interesting to see if I can
build my development experience over the next 9 months while I finish my
degree. Otherwise I'll take something that just keeps my brain ticking over
in another way.
