Summer has maybe, potentially, tentatively rolled around. This week has flown
by, I've been exploring environments for my dissertation.
<!--more-->
Currently my plan is to wrap a C implementation of Tetris designed for
linear value function iteration by Christophe Thiery and Bruno Scherrer in
Python so it can be used as an OpenAI Gym style environment. I need to learn
how to interface C with Python, get the library to generate the right shared
object files and all of that. I've followed a few simpler examples which
were fine, but this is a step up in terms of complexity. I've never really
worked with C libraries before so this is an interesting first.

Unfortunately failed my driving test this week, was just a bit too nervous
and made a stupid mistake. Just got to wait around until I can book another
one now.

Need to start the job search in earnest now. I haven't updated my CV for a
year, and I need to figure out how to pitch it right now. Working on drilling
the various Leetcode problems to get my skills up to scratch for any
interviews. Starting to flesh out some standard interview question responses.
Doing my best to prepare for playing the game of interviewing essentially.
The goal is a junior software dev job in Vancouver or remote in that timezone.
Will see how it goes.
