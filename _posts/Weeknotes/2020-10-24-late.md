Most exciting news of the week is that I've received my travel exemption so
I'll be visiting my partner in Canada for Christmas! It definitely feels weird
to be planning intercontinental travel at the moment<!--more-->, and there's still plenty
of things that could go wrong between now and then, but I'm incredibly excited
to see her. Feeling very lucky about the entire thing.

Things are picking up on the course at the moment. I have a lot of coursework
to juggle over the next 6 weeks, particularly now i have a slightly advance
deadline for completing them, but I'm chewing through the pile. The main
sticking point at the moment are two particularly meaty pieces for a Software
Engineering course. The deliverables are all about the process rather than the
product. It has been a good learning experience so far, exploring [agile
methodologies](https://agilemanifesto.org/) for working.  I'm currently
finishing up a report on agile processes, after which we have a group project
to build a game. Currently thinking we'll do something quite simple with
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org), but all of the learning objectives are around the process of working
with the group, so that takes some stress out of writing the code.

Aside from that, I've been working on the foundations of computation, which
involves a lot of state machines and the transition from finite automata to
regular languages and back. This course begins with deterministic finite
automata and ends with writing a parser, the first step along the way to a
compiler, so it's satisfyingly low level. The teaching is fantastic, and it's
immensely satisfying to work with mathematics where things are solvable, or
there's a right answer. It's nice to deal in relatively objective material
every now and again.

My driving test is in under two weeks now. This week was my first time driving
in the rain. We're descending back into the typically disgusting British
winter. The clocks go back tomorrow evening. Things are slowly happening one by
one. I'm not really reading many books at the moment, that's a practice I'd
like to get back into. I'm sitting in front of my computer and chewing through
a lot of articles, it leaves me feeling the sugar rush of what's happening and
I'm not sure I'm gaining much from any of it. It's good to have breadth, but I
worry about convincing myself I'm an armchair expert, running around spouting
shit. Well that's fixable anyway. Just have to sit down and do the work.
