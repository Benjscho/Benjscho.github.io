Spring, or something that feels creepily like it, is poking it's way in. The
days are an hour and a half longer than they were at the beginning of February.
<!--more-->By the end of March they'll be two hours longer again. After the
government lockdown exit roadmap announcement, and the continued amazing work
of the vaccine roll-out, I'm letting myself have a good square bit of hope.

I actually had a really tough time at the beginning of the week. I was
struggling to stay sane and motivated, which I feel is pretty understandable
at the moment. Picked up on part of the cause of it thanks to the last
[Blindboy podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6i7Yc33aY12BvSpsZc0gVE?si=Rki0qEhJSZCjcmMVBx-f8Q).
One of the points he made was that everyone at the moment is in essence living
with the symptoms of depression, if not the actual feeling. We're not able to
make our career goals, or go out and socialise, or leave the house that much.
I realised this was hitting me most whenever I had a bad day with getting my
MSc work done, since that's in essence the biggest thing tying my self-worth
down day to day. It's deeply linked to my career progression, since it's the
basis of any job I hope to get after, and indirectly a lynch pin of my personal
life, since I'm hoping to get a visa to move to Canada off the back of the
Express Entry points I'll gain from completing the degree, and I'm planning
to move to Canada to be with my partner Dani.

So essentially whenever I have a bad day with my courses, struggling to get
through material, the knock on feeling is that all of the other things in my
life are struggling or impacted too. And I am incredibly lucky to have the
support of friends and family, and to be in a great position financially, but
it helps a lot to put a name to those feelings when they come up. I don't have
many competing ways to positively fill my time at the moment. That's partly the
circumstances, and maybe partly something I can work on.

# Exercising

In other news just to feel something I bought an Apple watch SE this month,
and that's been slowly negging me into exercising daily with little taps
and many numbers. It's quite good, this is the first time I've kept
consistently active maybe ever? Definitely a big step up from parts of the past
year where my daily movement could best be described as a crawl. In April
of 2020 my daily average walking distance was under half a mile. While I was
definitely playing my part with not going outside, it definitely wasn't good
for my health in other ways. I stopped smoking all of 280 days ago, so this is
now my attempt to do the next best thing I can for my health and be more active.

# Uni progress

On the MSc front, I'm starting to get a bit bewildered by some of the material
coming at me. Still treading water for now, and the workload is relatively
light, but it's great to have some challenging topics to work through.

With regards to Reinforcement Learning, we've turned to take a square look at
[Temporal Difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_difference_learning)
methods, so really getting to what makes the field unique. We have a tricky-ish
coursework to implement and improve on a basic Q-Learning agent in a race-track
environment. I've done all of the easiest parts of that coursework, so now
I just have to have a good think for the rest.

On the Functional Programming side we're now getting into the weeds of the
$\lambda$-calculus, and the variable renaming parts of that are slightly
melting my brain. The course is really well structured, so getting through
the exercises definitely helps with comprehension, it's just not the easiest
going. And that's fine.

I'm taking my motorbike out a bit more now, just small trips around the
villages to build my confidence up (and stay within the lockdown restrictions).
I made the most adventurous trip I've been on in a month and a half by zipping
round to the nearest McDonald's drive through. After writing this I'm going
to go on a sunny Sunday ride, and then see if I can get some reading done
in the rest of the afternoon.
