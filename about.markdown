Hi, I'm Ben. I'm an MSc Computer Science student at the University of Bath,
this blog is currently tracking my progress there for the year.

Previously I studied English literature at Edinburgh for four very enjoyable
years (2014-18), spending a lot of time making
[theatre](https://www.eushakespeare.com/shows). I spent the intervening two
years working in IT in London before deciding to take the plunge and move into
software development.

Right now I'm working on:
- My dissertation, developing an environment for reinforcement learning in
  Tetris, and then applying some interesting algorithms to it
- Finding a job and moving to Vancouver (in whichever order) to be near my
  partner

If you'd like to chat to me about anything you can reach me at blog (at)
