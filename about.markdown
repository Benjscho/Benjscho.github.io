Hi, I'm Ben. I'm an MSc Computer Science student at the University of Bath, this blog will mainly be tracking my progress there for the next year.

Previously I studied English Lit at Edniburgh for four very enjoyable years
('14-'18), spending a lot of time making
[theatre](https://www.eushakespeare.com/shows). I spent the last two years
working in [IT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02a723LsoFA) in London for an
[emergency assistance company](https://www.northcottglobalsolutions.com/).

I'm interested in how things get made, and making them myself.
