Hi, I'm Ben! I'm a software developer at AWS, living in Vancouver and
originally from the UK. I started this blog to track my progress and work in
the open while I was doing my MSc in Computer Science in 2020/21. I haven't
updated it much since then, although I'd like to post more on what I'm
interested in.

Right now I'm working on/interested in:
- Learning how to be a better and faster engineer in my day job
- Starting to write some Rust
- Learning more about parsing, ASTs, compilers, and programming language
    theory.

If you'd like to chat to me about anything you can reach me at blog (at)
benjscho.dev
