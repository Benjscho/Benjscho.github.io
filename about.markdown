Hi, I'm Ben. I'm an MSc Computer Science student at the University of Bath, this blog will mainly be tracking my progress there for the next year.

Previously I studied English Lit at Edniburgh for four very enjoyable years, spending a lot of time making [theatre](https://www.eushakespeare.com/shows). The last two years I spent working in IT in London for an [emergency assistance company](https://www.northcottglobalsolutions.com/).

I'm interested in people doing cool things with software, showing solidarity with workers, and having good praxis.
